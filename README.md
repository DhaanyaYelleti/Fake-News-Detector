📘 Fake News Detector

  Mini Machine Learning project that detects fake news articles using classical ML algorithms along with NLP techniques.

🧠 Problem Statement

   Misinformation travels fast these days. For the project, this problem deals with fake news article detection based on the analysis of the content of the text and fake/real determination based on ML models.

📁 Dataset

  Used the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle, which contains:

  * Title of News Article
  * Text of News Article
  * Labels: True or False

🛠️ Tools & Techniques
    
  * Python, Jupyter Notebook
  * Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
  * TfidfVectorizer for text pre-processing
  * Multinomial Naive Bayes, Passive Aggressive Classifier
  * Train/Test Split, Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix

✅ Main characteristics

  * End-to-end ML pipeline: loading, cleaning, feature extraction, training, and evaluation of data
  * Easy to read, well-commented notebook
  * High accuracy was attained with classical models

📊 Results

  Accuracy Best Achieved: \~93% using Passive Aggressive Classifier
  Lightweight, efficient — ideal for resource-limited situations

🚀 Future Work

  * Try out deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
  * Add a simple frontend for user input
  * Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
